Decision Code Question 
85 - 100 -> Grade A 70 - 84 -> Grade B 55 - 69 -> Grade C 40 - 54 -> Grade D Below 40 -> Grade F  So, the program first asks me for the marks. Maybe take an input after printing “Enter marks: “ or something similar. Then use decision making and print “Grade A”, “Grade B”, “Grade C”, “Grade D” or “Grade F” based on the bins provided above.
